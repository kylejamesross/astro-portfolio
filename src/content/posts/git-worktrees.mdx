# Supercharge your workflow with Git Worktrees

Git Worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories for a single repository. This feature enables you to work on different branches simultaneously. It is particularly useful for managing context switching in Git. For instance, you can be developing a feature and then quickly switch to fixing a production bug by creating a new worktree for the bug fix branch.

## Listing your Worktrees

You can list your worktrees and their details by running the follow command in a git repository: 

`git worktree list`

The main worktree is always listed first, followed by each linked worktrees.

## Types of Worktrees
- Main
- Linked
